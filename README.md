# React-Native-Assignment
- The following is a simple implementation that tests your knowledge on a few things that most of our apps depend on.

# Deadline
- The deadline is 4 days after the initial commit.

# Deliverable
- You can send an unsigned apk / signed apk and/or an installable .ipa via Diawi or Firebase App Distribution (email it to: sai@moglix.com)

# Tech
- Not Skippable
- Redux (preferably with redux-saga)
- React Native UI Framework (Any UI Framework, Nativebase, RNElements, UIKitten, Nachos)
- Some form of Linting
- React Navigation (with or without react-native-router-flux)

# The Rules
- A Github repository to maintain the code
- I'll go through you commit history to figure out your thought process so make sure you write your commits properly
- The assignment is to test your skill level to what you claim to be so even if you can't complete the assignment completely, it is still fine to submit a half     baked version till the deadline so we can at least analyse the code quality.
- The deadline is 4 days after the initial commit.
- Your initial commit is just going to be a simple README.md file that has moglix assignment as its content.
- Make sure you update your readme with needed documentation, this can include any additional packages you've added that need linking or if you use your readme as   a todo list with checkbox, anything you think needs to be documented can be in the readme.
- Any tampering with the github history will lead to elimination, so force pushes aren't allowed. Use revert instead.

# The Assignment
The assignment is a very simple micro blogging platform. It's not a full fledged functional platform but let me test your skill levels. I'll give you the set of features I expect from it.

- Screens
  List all posts.
  Add a post.

 - List All Posts
   Simple screen that lists all the available posts, this can be fetched from any publicly available api. (ex. JSONPlaceholder)
   Bonus Functionality If you could add a manual frontend filtration logic that'll search through the title of the numerous posts.
   
 - Add a Post
   Since you can't post to the actual public api's just making the post request and showing a success message for it, works. So, You'll have a text box and a        submit button for me to make a post with.

- If you are ahead of the deadline and can add any other functionality that you think you'd like to add, you can, just make sure you list it in the Readme.
